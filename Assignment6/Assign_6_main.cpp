** Assignment 5  (Deadline: 24/03/2023)
** Name:  Aleksander Kedziora
** Student ID:  10458000
**
**
** Purpose: Creating a matrix with functionalities like calculating determinant, multiplying, cropping (removing a column and a row)
**        : Creating overloading function for arithmetic operation AND ostream(<<), istream(>>)
**
** Classes: Matrix(double, double) / Matrix(array, double, double)
**
** Comments : Not protected from division by 0
**          : Using uint32_t (or size_t) and putting negative value means value = size(uint32_t)-value.
				so user can put negative value but it will be turned into some large (2^32 - 1 - VALUE) positive value
			: User can creat its own matrix
			: Determinant is calculated using Expansion by Minors algorithm (a recursive alg.)
			: Multiplication and Determinant calculations were tested and compered with https://matrix.reshish.com/determinant.php
